Inspired by the BBC's "Your life on earth" - http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141016-your-life-on-earth - we will be creating a program to analyze the year a user was born in.

Please create a brand new file named homework-1-lastname.py
•	The first line should be a comment with your full name
•	The second line should be a comment with the date
•	The third line should be a comment "Homework 1"

Create a hupyter notebook file in Google Collab environment, this file should

1.	Prompt the user for their year of birth, and tell them (approximately):
2.	How old they are
3.	How many times their heart has beaten
4.	How many times a blue whale's heart has beaten
5.	How many times a rabbit's heart has beaten
6.	If the answer to (5) is more than a billion, say "XXX billion" instead of the very long raw number
7.	How old they are in Venus years
8.	How old they are in Neptune years
9.	Whether they are the same age as you, older or younger
10.	If older or younger, how many years difference
11.	If they were born in an even or odd year
12.	How many times the Pittsburgh Steelers have won the Superbowl since their birth.
13.	Which US President was in office when they were born (1935 onward)
Additionally, if someone gives you a year in the future, try asking them again (assume they'll do it right the second time).

## TIPS
•	How fast does a rabbit's heart beat? I don't know, I'm not a vet - Google it!
•	If you're having trouble wrapping your head around a problem, write out what you want to do in steps before you try to write the actual Python code.
•	XXX billion will involve division.
•	You might end up googling multiple comparisons in an 'if' statement, adding one to variables, the else and elif operators (that's advanced conditionals!), and modulo (for the even/odd one).
